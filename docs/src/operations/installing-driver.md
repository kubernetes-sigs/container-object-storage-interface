# Installing COSI Driver

There is no single and definitive guide for installing a COSI driver. The installation process may vary depending on the specific driver you are using and the platform it is being deployed on.

## General Installation Steps

1. **Check Compatibility**: Ensure the driver is compatible with your Kubernetes version and COSI API version.
2. **Refer to Driver Documentation**: Each driver may have unique requirements and steps. Refer to the documentation of [each driver](../drivers.md) for specific installation details. Many drivers provide Helm charts or Kubernetes manifests for easier deployment.
